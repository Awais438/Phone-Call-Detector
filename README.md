# Phone-Call-Detector
Digital Logic Design (DLD)

A mobile phone detector can detect the activation of a mobile phone such as; incoming
and ongoing phone calls, messages, and things in that nature. Mobile phone detectors
can be used for spying on someone and for unauthorized video transmission. Whenever
when the phone is on silent mode, a mobile phone detector can detector various things
from a mobile device. Overall, mobile phone detectors can prevent the use of mobile
phones in prisons, movie theaters, classrooms, and in any facility that individuals do not
allow cellphone usage
